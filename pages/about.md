## About the Collection

This collection was based on the book by Jim Dwyer (2010), _Where the Wild Books Are: A Field Guide to Ecofiction_, which is known as one of the most prominent
works that established a theoretical and conceptual framework of ecofiction through a bibliographic study of contemporary science fiction and environmental literature.
