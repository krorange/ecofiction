## About the Collection

In environment-oriented works of fiction, namely eco-fiction, environmental issues are typically represented by nonhuman entities, including but not limited to plants and animals. In other words, scientific terms referring to environmental issues, such as climate change, global warming, deforestation, ozone depletion, and air and water pollution, are more likely to appear in environmental nonfiction books, rather
than ecofiction novels. Instead, nonhuman agents in ecofiction play a key role in revealing major and minor aspects of the current ecological crisis through their reflections of reality. Even if these nonhuman animals do not directly engage in the narrative, they represent a marginalized reality of climate change, namely animal migration, in a fictional setting. In this regard, ecofiction novels provide nonhuman others with actor agency in uncanny ways that lead us to consider what the nonhuman can tell us about hidden aspects of the environmental crisis of our age.

This collection was based on the book by Jim Dwyer (2010), _Where the Wild Books Are: A Field Guide to Ecofiction_, which is known as one of the most prominent
works that established a theoretical and conceptual framework of ecofiction through a bibliographic study of contemporary science fiction and environmental literature.
